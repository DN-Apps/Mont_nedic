## About the project
This Project was devepeloped to be fully in charge of the features, that are neccessary to provide a functional room booking application.
These rooms are listed on other platforms, where interested customers can send contact mails to the landlord.
Theese platforms do not provide following features, which this self-developed application does:
- Floor plan
- Beautiful slim design
- Rooms availabilities
- Multi language features


It is still not fully developed to meet all the possible features, that are crossing my mind.
Some of these features could be:
- User area, where companies or regular requestors can have an insight to their requests and further useful information
- More languages, to cover the main countries the landlord is getting requests from

Dieses Projekt wurde entwickelt, um [Problem/Lösung beschreiben].  
Besonderes Augenmerk lag auf [z. B. Performance, Skalierbarkeit, Mehrsprachigkeit].
